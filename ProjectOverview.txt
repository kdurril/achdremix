Readme
The Allegheny Country Health Department restaurant inspection project is the result of several years of work.
The primary goal is to gather data for accessment purposes. This includes 4 major parts
1) Gathering restaurant ids from the ACHD Restaurant Health Inspection site
2) Pulling basic organizational data and inspection ids from the site
3) Pulling PFDs of the individual inspections based on inspection ids
4) Restructuring pdf data into full-text search database
5) Consider semi-supervised learning given structured and unstructured data for 

Files:
achd_direct_update
    in Python2.7
	retrieves restaurant id from achd query website
achd_scrapy project - this is a folder for scrapy
    in Python 2.7
    retrieves restaurant basic data and inspection id
    scrapy crawl achdspider -o achd_output.json -t json
achd_inspect_id / achd_inspect_id_3
    retrieves inspection pdf files
    converts pdf to text
achd_pdf_processor
    move convert_pdf to new module
inspection_parse.py
    parses text in 3 parts
    1) Restaurant and Inspection Metadata
    2) Assessment elements
    3) Violation blocks
achd_db.py
    creates the database to hold parsed record
    3 tables
    1) inspect
    2) assessment
    3) violation

achd_db_build.py
    uses inspection_parse to insert records into achd_db

achd_db_review.py
    series of tests to see how well the data was parsed and transfered

achd_textdb.py
    this should upload the inspections to Postgresql for full-text search

CHAIN EVENTS TOGETHER to scrape restaurant ids and end with parsed text documents
Set file names and folders so that date is included
Set logging

Review of parsed records for accurate reproduction of PDF data
    should each inspection id be unique?
    which field should not be null?

Data can be used to critique individual restaurants or the health department

Descriptive Stats

Inferential Stats

Research Questions:
Does the current warning system have an empirical basis for concern?
Could I use a clustering method to cluster the files
Then use a classification method to label the records and find similar records

Are any areas over or underrepresented by inspection rate given incidence of violations?

Is the inspector significant when including geography?

Are corporate restaurants more likely to be satisfatory, should less time be spent on corporates?

Can time from certification predict violations?

Are any assessment categories unobserved throughout the dataset?

Can we correlate any behaviors from this dataset to food safety training?

Can we correlate the behaviors to profit seeking? Might the violations, be driven by other factors?
What is the cost of a violation?
Is cost of a violation enough to deter that behavior?
Is the cost of a violation in consideration of harm to public health?
